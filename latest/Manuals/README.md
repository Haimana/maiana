### Assembly Manuals

As of January 2022, all kits ship in the configuration described in manual Rev 4. This manual combines and supersedes all other files in this directory.

Firmware updates for MAIANA will be carried out via the OpenPlotter app. The method described in the older manual here no longer applies.
